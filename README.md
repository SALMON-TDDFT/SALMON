# SALMON: Scalable Ab-initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience

SALMON is an open-source software based on first-principles time-dependent density functional theory
to describe optical responses and electron dynamics in matters induced by light electromagnetic fields.

SALMON has been developed in such a way that it runs optimally in the following supercomputer platforms:

- K-computer
- Fujitsu FX100 supercomputer system
- Linux PC Cluster with x86-64 CPU
- Linux PC Cluster with Intel Xeon Phi processor
