# SALMON: Scalable Ab-initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience

SALMON is an open-source software based on first-principles time-dependent density functional theory
to describe optical responses and electron dynamics in matters induced by light electromagnetic fields.

SALMON has been tested and optimized to run in the following supercomputer platforms:

- K-computer
- Fujitsu FX100 supercomputer system
- Linux PC Cluster with Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing architecture)
- Linux PC Cluster with x86-64 CPU
